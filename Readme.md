This is a small mod for keeping track of your air-drop packages until they 
hit the ground. Very good for those surface survey contracts in awkward 
locations.

It features two parts: the survey transponder itself (science), and a 0.625m
inline storage (ie, cargo bay/service module) (utilities).

The transponder automatically sets itself as target 2.2 seconds after it has
been staged (2s before deploying its arms, then 0.2s for the arms to fully 
deploy before it starts "transmitting"). The arms prevent the dropped package 
from rolling down moderate slopes. Once deployed, a status window will appear
giving the status (situation, altitude, velocity) of all transponders within
range.

Currently, the transponder is an otherwise standard probe core, but without
any electrical storage of its own. This is to allow science experiments to 
be run.
